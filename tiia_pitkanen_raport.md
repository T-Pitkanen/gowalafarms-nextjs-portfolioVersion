# Gowala Farms - Tiia Pitkänen - WebH123-1

**Gowala Farms – A family-run farm in Australia**

Gowala Farms' website serves as a functional prototype designed primarily for mobile devices. It includes features such as an API and backoffice for managing partners, employees, subscribers, articles, products, FAQs, orders, services, and contacts.


## Technologies Used

- Next.js: Used as the framework for building the website.
- MongoDB: Database used for storing data.
- @uidotdev/usehooks: Custom React hooks library.
- @aws-sdk/client-s3: Library for interacting with Amazon S3.
- yup: Library for schema validation.
- bcryptjs: Library for hashing passwords.
- dotenv: Used for managing environment variables.
- eslint: Tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- eslint-config-next: ESLint configuration specific to Next.js projects.
- mongoose: MongoDB object modelling tool.
- react: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- react-content-loader: Library for creating placeholder loading components.
- react-dom: Entry point for working with the DOM in React applications.
- react-icons: Library for including popular icons in React projects.
- react-spinners: Library for adding loading spinners to React components.
- swiper: Library for building touch sliders and carousels.


## Design and Pictures
We were given an Adobe XD file and told to follow the design in it. An assets folder was given as well for all of the images required.



## Installation and Usage

- Run "npm install" to install the node modules.
- Set up environment variables. 
- Run "npm run seed"
- Run "npm run dev" and access the website at http://localhost:3000





## Evaluation
I kept a schedule all through the development process. I had things I wanted to get done every day, and I finished them on time. However, I had a couple of challenges:

- I ran into issues with the product swiper when working on the 1024px home page view of products. Even though I put a lot of time and effort into fixing it, I eventually ran out of patience and decided to put other things on my priority list because of how frustrating it was.

- I wanted to use placeholders and preloaders for a better user experience. However, after researching, I realized the process was more complex and time-consuming than I expected, so I decided to skip it.

Overall, I feel like I finished the project well and did pretty much everything I intended to accomplish. 


## Argumentation for the Choices I Made

The majority of the decisions I made during the process were affected by my experience from school and previous projects. I chose to use known technologies, frameworks, and code that I'd previously seen and used. 

Using familiar tools and techniques simplified the process, allowing me to work more productively and confidently, because I didn't have much time to complete the project.

But not everything was familiar. I did use some new techniques, but largely I relied on familiarity to optimize efficiency.

## Origins of the Various Code Elements

Most of the code was recycled from past projects and templates, which I adjusted to match this project. I also used Copilot to aid with suggestions and snippets, which I modified to fit the project.
